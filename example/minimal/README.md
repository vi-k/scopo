# minimal

One scope, in as few files as it takes: `lib/main.dart`, 245 lines.

"Minimal" is about the number of files and the number of scopes, not about the
number of lines: what it walks through is `Scope`, the largest family, with its
dependency container, its state and its four branches, commented step by step.
If what you want is the smallest thing that works, the table of families in the
[README](https://github.com/vi-k/scopo#the-families) points at `ScopeModel` or
`ScopeWidgetBase`, and either fits in fifteen lines.

```sh
cd example/minimal
flutter run
```

## What it shows

`App` is a full `Scope` with all three parts, and the file is laid out in that
order:

1. **`App`** — the scope widget. It carries one parameter, `title`, and exposes
   the four accessors a scope normally re-exports under its own name:
   `paramsOf` and `selectParam` for the parameter, `of` and `select` for the
   state.
2. **`AppDependencies`** — the container, initialized asynchronously.
   `SharedPreferences` is what it waits for, and the progress it reports is the
   `String` shown on the splash screen.
3. **`AppState`** — the state. It reads the counter from the storage in
   `initState`, and `increment()` mutates it, calls `notifyDependents()` and
   writes it back.

The three branches are each built with their own `MaterialApp`, which is what
`wrapState` being ready-only means in practice — `_app({required child})` in
the file exists exactly for that. `pauseAfterInitialization` is set to 500 ms so
that the splash screen can be seen at all on a fast machine.

`main()` also assigns the observer — `ScopeConfig.observer = const
ScopePrintObserver()` — which prints a line per lifecycle event. Run it and the
console shows the scope initializing, reporting progress, becoming ready, and —
when the app is closed — disposing of itself in order.

## What to try

- Pass `trace: true` to the `ScopePrintObserver` in `main()` to see the
  machinery under the lifecycle — the `scopeKey` queue, the initialization and
  teardown — and not only the milestones.
- Make `AppDependencies.init` throw after the first `ctx.progress` to land on
  the error branch.
- Set `ScopeConfig.pauseAfterInitializationEnabled = false` to see how fast the
  ready branch really arrives.

The topics behind all of this are the `Scope` and `debug` pages of the
[documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/scopo/latest/).
