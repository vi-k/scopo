# AsyncScope

A scope whose whole content is a lifecycle: an asynchronous initialization and
an asynchronous disposal, with no dependency container and no state class. Use
it when the objects already exist — a singleton, a connection, a repository
owned by a parent scope — and only their starting and stopping has to follow
the widget tree.

```dart
AsyncScope(
  initScope: (context, ctx) async {
    ctx.progress('connecting');
    await connection.open();
  },
  disposeScope: () => connection.close(),
  waitingBuilder: (context) => const SizedBox.shrink(),
  progressBuilder: (context, progress) => Text('$progress'),
  errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace, progress) => Text('$error'),
  builder: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
);
```

`AsyncScopeBase` is the subclassable form: the same members as overrides —
`initScope`, `disposeScope`, `onMount`, `onUnmount`, `buildOnWaiting`,
`buildOnProgress`, `buildOnReady`, `buildOnError` — plus `scopeKey`,
`scopeKeyTimeout`, `initCancellationTimeout`, `disposeScopeTimeout`,
`waitForChildrenTimeout`, their `onTimeout` callbacks and
`pauseAfterInitialization`. `AsyncScopeCore` sits under both for a scope that
needs its own element.

## The four states

`AsyncScopeState` is a sealed hierarchy, and each state drives one builder:

| state | builder | when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AsyncScopeWaiting` | `buildOnWaiting`, or `buildOnProgress` when it returns `null` | mounted; waiting for a `scopeKey` and for the first event |
| `AsyncScopeProgress` | `buildOnProgress` | `initScope` reported progress; the value is `progress` |
| `AsyncScopeReady` | `buildOnReady` | `initScope` returned |
| `AsyncScopeError` | `buildOnError` | `initScope` failed before it was ready; the progress it had reached comes with it |

`initScope` says only two of those four things, and names neither:
`ctx.progress(x)` is the progress, and returning is the ready. "Waiting" and
"failed" belong to the scope rather than to the work — the first is where a
scope starts, and the second is what a throw makes of it.

The ready state is not applied in the same frame the event arrives in. Without
`pauseAfterInitialization` the scope schedules a post-frame callback, so the
last progress value gets a frame to itself instead of being replaced within the
frame it appeared in; with it, the ready branch is held back for that duration.
`ScopeConfig.pauseAfterInitializationEnabled = false` turns all such pauses off
globally — see the `debug` topic.

## Progress

Progress is whatever the initialization says it is. `AsyncScopeProgress` carries
an `Object?`, the builders receive an `Object?`, and the package never looks
inside it. A `String` is the common case; anything with a `toString` will do.

```dart
AsyncScope(
  initScope: (context, ctx) async {
    ctx.progress('connecting');
    await api.connect();

    ctx.progress('loading the profile');
    await api.loadProfile();
  },
  disposeScope: api.close,
  progressBuilder: (context, progress) => Center(child: Text('$progress')),
  errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace, progress) =>
      Center(child: Text('failed at $progress: $error')),
  builder: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
);
```

Four things are worth knowing about the `progress` argument.

**It is `null` before the first event.** The scope is `AsyncScopeWaiting` from
the moment it is mounted until `initScope` reports, and if `buildOnWaiting` returns
`null` the waiting branch is `buildOnProgress(context, null)`. Write the
builder so that `null` means "nothing reported yet" — that is also what it means
in `buildOnError` when the failure came before any progress did.

**The last value gets a frame of its own.** `AsyncScopeReady` is applied in a
post-frame callback, so a progress value reported immediately before the body
returns is actually painted instead of being replaced within the same frame.
`pauseAfterInitialization` holds the ready branch back further still, which is
what to reach for when the steps are too fast to read.

**Progress after ready has nowhere to go.** The scope is initialized once;
a progress call made after it is ready — by a helper the body left running,
say — is ignored and does not change what is on screen. An initialization
that goes on producing values after the scope is usable wants a `Listenable`
under the scope, not this context.

**No progress at all is fine.** An `initScope` that reports nothing never
leaves `AsyncScopeWaiting`, so the scope shows `buildOnWaiting` — a spinner,
usually — and then the ready branch.

### Counting steps

For an initialization that knows how many steps it has, `ProgressIterator`
counts them and `Progress` is the value it produces: `number`, `total`,
`value` as a fraction between 0 and 1, and a `toString` of `2/3`.

```dart
initScope: (context, ctx) async {
  final steps = ProgressIterator(3);

  ctx.progress(steps.nextStep()); // 1/3
  await api.connect();

  ctx.progress(steps.nextStep()); // 2/3
  await api.loadProfile();

  ctx.progress(steps.nextStep()); // 3/3
  await api.warmUpCache();
},
progressBuilder: (context, progress) => switch (progress) {
  final Progress progress => LinearProgressIndicator(value: progress.value),
  _ => const LinearProgressIndicator(),
},
```

The fraction is always between 0 and 1 — an empty task reads as complete rather
than as `NaN` — so it can go straight into a progress indicator. See the `utils`
topic.

### Where the type comes back

`ctx.progress` takes an `Object` and the builders receive an `Object?`, so the
type of a progress value is the builder's to declare: `buildOnProgress` can say
`covariant Progress? progress` and read fields instead of calling `toString`.
`ScopeAutoDependencies` reports a `ScopeAutoDependenciesProgress` per
dependency — the path, the name and the step counter in one object. See the
`Scope` topic.

The package itself never looks inside a progress value. Progress is a caption;
the type parameter a family has, where it has one, belongs to the value being
built.

## Reading the state from the subtree

```dart
final scope = AsyncScope.of(context, listen: true);
if (scope.isInitialized) { … }
```

`of`, `maybeOf` and `select` return an `AsyncScopeContext`, which exposes
`state`, `isInitialized` (the state is `AsyncScopeReady`), `hasError`, and
`error` / `stackTrace`, both of which throw a `StateError` when there is no
error. Reading a single field through `select` is the usual way in, since it
subscribes to that field alone — the `base` topic explains the filtering.

## Errors

A body that throws before the scope is ready puts it into `AsyncScopeError`,
and `buildOnError` receives the error, its stack trace, and the progress the
scope had reached when it failed.

One failure is handled differently, and deserves to be known.

**An error with no outcome of its own** — a late failure of an action abandoned
by `wait`, a disposer, an `onCancel` callback or work started by `unattended` —
reaches `ScopeObserver.onError` and `FlutterError.reportError`. It does not
switch the screen to `buildOnError`, and a ready scope stays ready. That is
deliberate: the widgets on screen are the ready ones, whatever `initScope`
acquired still has to be released by `disposeScope`, and
swapping the subtree for an error screen behind the user's back would strand
both. A body that goes on working after it has returned — a helper it left
running — is unusual, but it is exactly the case where the difference matters.
Bare asynchronous work outside the context still reports to its own zone.

## Disposal, in order

The teardown runs as one sequence, and every asynchronous step of it is
awaited:

1. **`onUnmount`** — synchronous, and always first. Whatever must stop reaching
   the scope at once is dropped here: subscriptions, listeners. It runs exactly
   once, whichever way the scope goes — removed from the tree, or closed with
   `close()` while it stays on screen.
2. **The wait for a `scopeKey` is cancelled**, if the scope was still queueing
   for one.
3. **The initialization is cancelled**, and the wait for that is bounded by
   `initCancellationTimeout` (`ScopeConfig.defaultInitCancellationTimeout` by
   default). Cancellation waits for the body, its child jobs and cleanup.
   The body learns of it through `ctx.progress`, `check` or the waiting
   family, which throws `Cancelled` according to the call's rules below —
   and a failure raised while it unwinds is reported rather than thrown on:
   abandoning the disposal at that point would
   leave the scope registered with its parent and its `scopeKey` unreleased.
   A cancellation that never finishes at all would leave it there just as
   surely, and needs no failure to do it: a body parked on somebody else's
   future is not interrupted by anything, and one that never asks `ctx`
   anything is never told. When the limit expires the initialization is left
   where it stands, the expiry is reported, and the teardown goes on. What the
   body holds stays held — and if it finishes later, what it produced is handed
   to `disposeScope`, unless the teardown has by then run to its end. Cleanup
   registered with the job does not need that hook and still runs.
4. **The initialization is awaited** if it could not be cancelled.
5. **The child scopes are awaited**, bounded by `waitForChildrenTimeout`
   (`ScopeConfig.defaultWaitForChildrenTimeout` by default). An expiry is
   reported through `FlutterError.reportError` and the disposal proceeds.
6. **`disposeScope`** — the scope's own teardown, awaited when it returns a
   future, and bounded by `disposeScopeTimeout`
   (`ScopeConfig.defaultDisposeScopeTimeout` by default). It runs only when the
   initialization succeeded: a scope that never became ready — still waiting,
   or failed — has nothing to release. A teardown that never completes is user
   code holding step 7 below, and with it the `scopeKey` of a scope that has
   already left the tree; on expiry that is reported and step 7 runs anyway,
   while the teardown itself is left to finish whenever it does.
7. **The scope unregisters from its parent and releases its `scopeKey`**, which
   lets the next scope waiting on that key through.

Every step is guarded on its own: a failure in one is never a reason to skip
the ones behind it. Only one failure can be passed on, though — that is all a
throw carries — and it is the first one, handed over once the whole sequence is
over: to whoever called `close()`, or, for a scope taken off the tree, to the
zone the teardown ran in. Every failure behind it is reported through
`FlutterError.reportError` instead.

The order is what makes the family worth using: a parent never disposes of
something while a child is still using it, and a re-created scope never
overlaps with the one it replaces.

### An initialization that fails owns its own mess

Step 6 is the one to read twice: **`disposeScope` runs only when the initialization
succeeded.** A scope that failed halfway never reaches it, and there is no
second hook that does — `onUnmount` runs, but it is handed nothing to work
with.

That is not an oversight, and it is not a gap waiting to be closed: **a scope
that failed needs a partial teardown, and only the code that did the building
knows which part.** `disposeScope` is written against a scope that is finished
and does the whole of it — asking it to also work out how far an initialization
got would put that question into the one hook that is meant to be free of it.
So it is the initialization's job to give back what it took before it failed:

```dart
// Wrong: the connection is open and nobody will ever close it.
initScope: (context, ctx) async {
  connection = await Api.connect();
  await connection.authenticate();           // throws
},
disposeScope: () => connection.close(),      // never called
```

```dart
// Right: what a step took is given back unless the scope took it over.
initScope: (context, ctx) async {
  final opened = await Api.connect();

  try {
    ctx.progress('authenticating');
    await opened.authenticate();
  } on Object {
    await opened.close();
    rethrow;
  }

  connection = opened;
},
disposeScope: () => connection.close(),
```

**`catch`, and no flag** — and both halves of that are worth saying, because
the older form of this package needed the opposite of each.

An initialization ends early in two ways: a step of it fails, or the scope goes
away before it was ever ready, removed from the tree or `close()`d. Both arrive
in the body as a throw — the second one as `Cancelled`, raised by a checkpoint
such as `ctx.progress` between two steps — so one `catch` covers both.
`Cancelled` comes from `async_job` and is re-exported by `scopo`; catching it
needs no separate dependency or import.

There is a third way, and it is the body's own: `throw Cancelled('why')` gives
up on an initialization that has decided to stop -- no session, nothing to
show, a precondition that did not hold. The scope treats it as a failure,
because that is what it is from the screen's side: an initialization that
never became ready. The `Cancelled` reaches `buildOnError` and
`ScopeObserver.onError` the way a failing step would -- and, like a failing
step, it does not go to `FlutterError`: the error is on the screen, and a red
line in the console for something a builder is already showing says nothing
new. Only a cancellation the teardown asked for is silent, and it can afford
to be: somebody is waiting for it.

A body that touches the context nowhere is the exception that proves it:
nothing is thrown at it, because Dart cannot interrupt somebody else's wait,
and it runs to its end for a scope that is already gone. That is not a hole.
What it produces then is handed to `disposeScope` rather than lost, which is
the promise the next section is about.

There is no flag because there is nothing to guard against. Returning is the
handover, and a body that returned has no lines left to run: reaching the
`catch` and reaching the handover are exclusive by construction, so the guard
cannot release something the scope has taken over. Where the guard has to know
the difference from *inside* — a body with several steps releasing them in
reverse — collect the releases as they are taken:

```dart
final acquired = <Future<void> Function()>[];

try {
  final database = await Database.open();
  acquired.add(database.close);

  ctx.progress('connecting');
  final session = await Session.connect();
  acquired.add(session.close);

  connection = Connection(database, session);
} on Object {
  for (final release in acquired.reversed) {
    await release();
  }
  rethrow;
}
```

Keep what the guard awaits able to finish. Nothing downstream sees the failure
until the body is done with it, so an `await` in the guard holds the failure as
well as the resource: a `close()` that never completes leaves the scope showing
its loading branch until `initCancellationTimeout` expires, with nothing on
screen and nothing in the console. The scope's own waits are all bounded for
this reason, and so is the one the dependency container of the `Scope` family
makes on your behalf. A guard you write yourself, or cleanup registered with
the job, must be able to finish too; the job puts no timeout around a disposer.

### What goes through the context, and what does not

`ScopeInitContext` adds `progress` to `JobContext`. Dart cannot interrupt
somebody else's `await`, so the body hears about cancellation through
checkpoints: `progress`, `check`, `wait`, `join`, `uncancellable`, `onCancel`
and `run`. Registering cleanup and starting `unattended` work still work after
cancellation while the job is alive; `ctx.job.isCancelled` answers without
throwing.

**`wait` with `discard:` is the form to reach for when an acquisition can be
left in flight.** It ends the waiting rather than the work. The action runs on,
but the value has someone to close it even if it never reaches the body:

```dart
final opened = await ctx.wait(Api.connect, discard: (api) => api.close());
```

The rule is one: **a value that never reaches the body is cleaned up
unconditionally; a value that does goes on the cleanup stack.** An abandoned
`wait` puts its value on the stack while the job is still unwinding it, or
closes it on the spot if the job is already over. On that stack, `discard:`
runs on failure or cancellation; `dispose:` runs whatever the outcome. Use
`dispose:` for a temporary file, a lock or a subscription the body keeps to
itself, and pass only one of the two.

For a read, a warm-up or a pause there may be nothing to release:

```dart
await ctx.wait(cache.warmUp);   // let go the moment the scope gives up
```

**`join` is for a call that must not be left halfway** — a migration, a device
write, somebody else's `init`. It accepts cancellation at once but waits for
the call to finish before throwing `Cancelled`; an error from the call still
arrives as that error. It replaces the old pair
`await x(); ctx.check();`, keeping the wait and the check together:

```dart
await ctx.join(database.migrate);
```

For a `join` that returns a resource, pass `discard:` or `dispose:` too; a
value the body will not receive is released before the cancellation is thrown.
`ctx.check()` still belongs where there is no call to wrap, such as a loop over
work of your own. `await ctx.uncancellable(step)` holds cancellation back for
a step that must not be cancelled at all; it is delivered when the step ends.
`ctx.unattended(work)` starts work nobody waits for and reports its errors to
the observer; it neither waits for nor cancels that work.

For a value the body already holds, `onDispose` and `onDiscard` register the
same two kinds of cleanup. They return a function that unregisters it;
`disown(value)` instead removes cleanup attached to that value by `wait` or
`join`. The stack unwinds in reverse registration order, after the child jobs
and before the outcome, awaiting each release:

```dart
ctx.onDispose(temporary.close);          // released on every outcome
final unregister = ctx.onDiscard(session.close); // on failure or cancellation
final opened = await ctx.wait(Api.connect, discard: (api) => api.close());

connection = Connection(opened, session);
// Handed to the scope: its disposeScope now owns both releases.
ctx.disown(opened);
unregister();
```

Remove those registrations at the handover, with no `await` or checkpoint
between it and returning. Otherwise the job's cancellation cleanup and the
scope's release of a late return would both close the same resource. A
registration made by `onDispose` or `onDiscard` has no value attached, so
`disown` cannot remove it; use the returned function, as above.

**A bare call is still right for a short initialization that asks the context
nothing.** The reason that is safe is a promise of the scope rather than a
hope: **a body that comes back for a scope which has already given up settles
nothing, but what it produced is released rather than dropped** —
`disposeScope` here, `disposeData` in the `AsyncDataScope` topic,
the container's own teardown in the `Scope` one. The one path where it cannot
is a teardown that has already finished, an `initCancellationTimeout` it gave
up on: by then the scope has no widget left to read the hook from.

For several dependencies with an order of their own, the dependency container
of the `Scope` family keeps the tree and its teardown — see the `Scope` topic.
`AsyncControllerScope` closes the same hole from the other side: its
controller is disposed of on **every** path, including the one where `init()`
threw.

## Parents and children

Every asynchronous scope registers with the nearest `AsyncScopeParent` above
it — a parent scope if there is one, an `AsyncScopeCoordinator` otherwise —
and that is what step 5 above waits for. The mixin exposes what it knows:

```dart
hasChildren;    // bool
childrenCount;  // int
await waitForChildren(timeout: …, onTimeout: …);
```

Written without a receiver on purpose: **the mixin sits on the element**, and
the elements of the five built-in families are private. So those three are for
a scope of your own — a family built on `AsyncScopeCore`, reading them on
`this` — and not for a subtree looking upwards. `AsyncScope.of(context, listen:
false)` and its siblings hand back an `AsyncScopeContext`, which carries the
state of the scope and none of this.

From a subtree, the wait to ask for is the coordinator's:

```dart
await AsyncScopeCoordinator.waitForChildren(context);
```

It waits for the scopes registered with the nearest coordinator — the ones with
no parent scope above them — and not for the children of one particular scope.
Waiting for those, from outside the scope that has them, is not something the
built-in families offer.

`waitForChildren` awaits the children registered **at the moment of the call**.
A child that registers while the wait is running is not awaited by it, and is
still registered once it is over. On expiry the children that never finished
are dropped, `onTimeout` is called — by default a `FlutterError.reportError`
naming the scope, and a callback of your own is handed that same named error —
and the future completes normally either way. Nothing here
deadlocks; it degrades into a delay and a report.

A scope with neither a parent scope nor a coordinator above it registers
nowhere, and nothing waits for it. That is worth knowing before removing a
coordinator that looked decorative.

## scopeKey and the coordinator

`scopeKey` serializes scopes that must not overlap. A scope with a key waits at
the head of a queue until the previous holder of that key has finished
disposing of itself — the whole seven-step sequence above, not just its removal
from the tree.

The queues belong to the nearest `AsyncScopeCoordinator`:

```dart
AsyncScopeCoordinator(child: MaterialApp(home: HomeScreen()))
```

Two consequences follow from "the nearest". Two scopes with equal keys under
different coordinators never wait for one another. And the queues live on the
coordinator's element, so serialization holds only as long as that element
does: replacing the coordinator — a different `ValueKey`, a different place in
the tree — throws its queues away with it. Above everything that can be
replaced is therefore the right place for it, and above `MaterialApp` is the
usual one.

A scope with a `scopeKey` and no coordinator above it fails loudly:

```text
No AsyncScopeCoordinator.
The AsyncScopeCoordinator is missing in the context. Add it to the widget tree
so that all your scopes that need it can access it. The most universal solution
is to place it above MaterialApp. …
```

The coordinator is also the wait root for the scopes in its subtree that have
no parent scope, which is what makes it useful without any `scopeKey` at all:

```dart
await AsyncScopeCoordinator.waitForChildren(context);
```

before tearing down a test, or before leaving a splash screen. Its `timeout`
defaults to `ScopeConfig.defaultWaitForChildrenTimeout`, and an expiry behaves
exactly as above: reported, not thrown.

## Where to go next

| topic | what it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `AsyncDataScope` | this family plus one value produced by the initialization |
| `LiteScope` | a state class with the same lifecycle, and `close()` |
| `Scope` | the full family: a dependency container on top of all this |
| `ScopeNotifier` | the state models this family is built on |
| `debug` | the observer that reports every step above, and the timeouts |
