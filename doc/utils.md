# utils

Helpers that ship with the package but belong to no scope family. They are
exported because the scopes themselves are built on them and an application
tends to want the same tools; nothing here needs a scope above it.

| helper | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `ListenableListenExtension.listen` | `Stream`-style subscription to a `Listenable` |
| `ListenableSelectExtension.select` | a listener called only when a selected value changes |
| `ListenableSelector` | the widget form of that selector |
| `ListenableView` | a read-only façade over a `Listenable` |
| `StateAsNotifier` | a mixin that makes a `State` listenable |
| `ProgressIterator`, `Progress` | step counting for an initialization |
| `ScreenshotReplacer` | freezes a subtree into the image it last painted |
| `CompareUtils` | four comparison functions with names |
| `IsBuildingExtension` | is a build running, and how to wait for the end of it |

## Listening to a Listenable

`addListener` and `removeListener` require keeping the callback around, which
is why a closure cannot be unsubscribed without storing it somewhere. `listen`
returns the subscription instead, the way `Stream` does:

```dart
final subscription = counter.listen(() => print(counter.value));
…
subscription.cancel();
```

`CompositeListenableSubscription` collects several of them and cancels the lot
in one call.

`select` narrows the callback to one value:

```dart
final subscription = model.select(
  (model) => model.userName,
  (model, userName) => print(userName),
);
```

The listener runs only when the selected value changes. By default that means
`!=`, and `compare:` replaces the test with one of your own. It answers the
same question, so `true` means changed: `notIdentical` for a value that is
replaced rather than mutated, a field-by-field comparison for a record, and so
on. Passing `identical` there reports the opposite of what it is asked — the
same object counts as a change and a replacement goes unnoticed. This is the
same idea `select` uses on a scope, without a widget tree involved.

`ListenableSelector` is the widget wrapping the same mechanism:

```dart
ListenableSelector<Counter, int>(
  listenable: counter,
  selector: (counter) => counter.value,
  builder: (context, counter, value, child) => Text('$value'),
);
```

The `child` it takes is passed back to `builder` untouched, the standard way of
keeping a subtree out of the rebuild.

`ListenableView` wraps a `Listenable` so that only `addListener` and
`removeListener` are reachable — hand it out when the subtree may listen but
must not notify. `ScopeStateModelView` in the `ScopeNotifier` topic is the same
idea applied to a state model.

`StateAsNotifier` goes the other way: mix it into a `State` and the state
itself becomes a `Listenable`, with a `notifyListeners()` for its own use. The
`ChangeNotifier` behind it is created on the first listener and disposed of
with the state, so a state nobody listens to costs nothing.

## ProgressIterator

Step counting for an initialization that knows how many steps it has:

```dart
final progress = ProgressIterator(3);

progress.nextStep(); // 1/3
progress.nextStep(); // 2/3
progress.addSteps(1); // 3/3
progress.isCompleted; // true
```

`Progress` is the value it produces: `number`, `total`, `value` as a fraction
between 0 and 1, and a `toString` of `2/3`. The fraction holds those bounds
whatever the pair says: a task of no steps at all reads as complete rather than
as the `NaN` of `0 / 0`, so it can go straight into a
`LinearProgressIndicator`. Stepping past the total is a mistake in the caller
and is caught by an assertion.

Reporting these from an initialization is the `AsyncScope` topic;
`ScopeAutoDependencies` uses exactly this to report a step per dependency — see
the `Scope` topic.

## ScreenshotReplacer

Renders its child once, captures what was painted, and then shows the image in
its place. The package uses it for `close()`: the last frame of a scope is
frozen while the asynchronous disposal runs, so the closing screen is drawn
over a still picture rather than over a subtree that is being torn down.

```dart
ScreenshotReplacer(
  onCompleted: () => print('captured, or given up on'),
  child: const HomeScreen(),
);
```

A subtree that is never painted — inside an `Offstage`, or in the unselected
branch of an `IndexedStack` — cannot be captured. The attempt is therefore
bounded by `ScreenshotReplacer.maxRetries` frames, after which `onCompleted` is
called anyway — and the child is taken away all the same, with nothing in the
picture's place. Nothing is reported: that is the case this widget documents as
ordinary, and `onCompleted` together with the absence of a picture is how it is
said. Giving up on the picture is not giving up on replacing the child: what
waits on `onCompleted` waits in order to let go of whatever the child holds,
and a child left standing gives that caller the report without the thing it was
reported for. `onCompleted` fires exactly once per state, whichever way it
ended, including when the widget is removed from the tree first.

## The two small ones

`CompareUtils` is `equals`, `notEquals`, `identical` and `notIdentical` as
named functions, for the places that take a comparison as a parameter —
`compare:` above, among others — where a tear-off reads better than a lambda.

`IsBuildingExtension` extends `SchedulerBinding`. `isBuilding` says whether a
build is running, and `runOutsideFrame(action)` runs the action now if it is
safe, or in a post-frame callback if one is. This is what a scope uses to keep
a notification out of the middle of a build.

A build is not only what a frame runs: `runApp` builds the first tree with no
frame in progress, and marking an element dirty from inside *that* is refused
just the same. `isBuilding` therefore adds two sources to the frame phase — the
rebuilds of this package's own scopes, which it counts itself, and the build
owner's flag, which it can only ask behind an assertion because that is the
only place the flag exists. So the one case left unanswered is a build that
neither belongs to a frame nor to this package, in a release build.

| topic | what it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `ScopeNotifier` | the scope form of `select`, and the state models |
| `Scope` | `ProgressIterator` in the dependency container, and `close()` |
| `LiteScope` | `close()` and the screenshot in their own family |
