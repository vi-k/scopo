# ScopeModel

A scope that owns one plain Dart object and hands it to its subtree. No
asynchronous phase, no dependency container, no state class: the object is
created when the scope is mounted and released when it leaves the tree.

Use it for anything the tree should own but nothing observes automatically — a
repository, a controller, a service, a form model. When the object is a
`Listenable` and its changes should reach the subtree by themselves, use the
`ScopeNotifier` topic instead; it is this family plus a subscription.

## The three levels

| class | when |
| --- | --- |
| `ScopeModel<M>` | the usual case: a widget with `create`, `dispose` and `builder` |
| `ScopeModelBase<W, M>` | a named scope of your own, with its own accessors |
| `ScopeModelCore<W, E, M>` | an element of your own; the base of the two above |

### ScopeModel

```dart
ScopeModel<Cart>(
  create: (context) => Cart(),
  dispose: (cart) => cart.close(),
  builder: (context) => const CartScreen(),
);
```

`builder` deliberately receives only a context. That context belongs to the
scope's element, so the model is already available through `ScopeModel.of` and
`ScopeModel.select`, with the same lookup and subscription rules that
descendants use. `dispose` runs at the other end of the lifecycle, outside a
build; the element already owns the exact model it created, so it hands that
instance to the callback directly instead of asking teardown code to look it up
through the tree.

`create` runs once, after the element is mounted and before its first subtree
build. If it throws, that is the end of the scope: `create` is not attempted
again and the scope shows an error instead of its subtree. `dispose` runs when
the element is unmounted, and only for a model that was actually created — a
failed `create` has nothing to hand over. The `context` handed to `create` is
the scope's own element, so an ancestor scope can be read from it —
`ScopeModel.of<Session>(context, listen: false)` — but with `listen: false`
only: `create` is called once and never again, so a subscription taken there
would rebuild the subtree around a value that stays as it was. An assertion
catches it.

"A failed `create` has nothing to hand over" is worth reading as a warning as
well: a `create` that takes two things and fails between them leaves the first
one behind, since the scope never learned of it. Either build the model in one
step that cannot fail halfway, or give the first thing back before letting the
failure out:

```dart
create: (context) {
  final channel = Channel.open();

  try {
    return Session(channel, Store.open());
    // ignore: avoid_catching_errors
  } on Object {
    channel.close();

    rethrow;
  }
},
```

`ScopeModel.value` takes a model somebody else owns:

```dart
ScopeModel.value(value: cart, builder: (context) => const CartScreen());
```

There is no `dispose` on that constructor at all, and it is not an omission:
whoever created the object disposes of it. The scope only provides it.

Descendants read the model through the same three accessors, and here they
return the model itself rather than a context:

```dart
final cart = ScopeModel.of<Cart>(context, listen: false);
final total = ScopeModel.select<Cart, int>(context, (cart) => cart.total);
```

### ScopeModelBase

Subclass it when the scope deserves a name and its own vocabulary:

```dart
final class CartScope extends ScopeModelBase<CartScope, Cart> {
  const CartScope({
    super.key,
    super.tag,
    required super.create,
    required super.dispose,
    required super.child,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => child;

  static Cart of(BuildContext context) =>
      ScopeModelBase.of<CartScope, Cart>(context, listen: false).model;

  static int totalOf(BuildContext context) =>
      ScopeModelBase.select<CartScope, Cart, int>(
        context,
        (scope) => scope.model.total,
      );
}
```

Two differences from `ScopeModel` are worth noticing. `build` is yours, so the
scope decides what it shows instead of taking a `builder`. And the accessors of
the base class return a `ScopeModelContext<W, M>` — the element — so a selector
reads `scope.model` rather than the model directly. Wrapping them in named
statics hides both details from the call site.

`ScopeModelCore` sits under all of this for the case where the element itself
has to be replaced; `ScopeNotifier` is exactly that case.

## What notifies whom

The model is not observed. Nothing inside it can tell the scope that something
changed — mutating a field of `Cart` reaches no descendant on its own.

What the scope does notify on is its own rebuild: when the parent rebuilds the
`ScopeModel` widget, the dependents are notified and their selectors decide who
is actually rebuilt. So a value that changes has to travel through the widget:

```dart
ScopeModel.value(value: cart, builder: (context) => const CartScreen());
```

with a `StatefulWidget` above holding `cart` and calling `setState` — the model
stays the same object, the scope widget is rebuilt, and only the descendants
whose selected value changed follow.

If that reads like a workaround, it is: a model that changes on its own belongs
in `ScopeNotifier`, where a `notifyListeners()` becomes a notification without
any rebuild above. `ScopeModel` is for objects that either do not change or
change only when the tree above them changes.

## Lifetime

`create` is called from `init()` once the element is mounted and before its
first subtree build, so a successfully-created model is ready for anything
below it. A thrown `create` is terminal: it is not called again.

`dispose` is called from `dispose()` of the element, after the base class has
run its own teardown. The element disposer runs after a failed initialization
too, but `dispose` itself is called only for a model the scope actually
created — a `.value` model, and a `create` that threw, are both left alone.

The lifetime is the element's, not the widget's. A scope rebuilt with new
parameters keeps its model; a scope removed from the tree loses it. Moving a
scope with a `GlobalKey` moves the element and the model with it.

Which constructor the scope was built with is fixed for that same lifetime. A
rebuild that switches between `ScopeModel(create:)` and `ScopeModel.value` has
no honest answer — arriving at the owning constructor there is nothing to own,
since `create` runs once and has already not run; leaving it, the model this
scope made is still its to release and the widget that says who releases it is
gone — so an assertion refuses it. Give the widget a different `Widget.key`
instead, and the framework builds a new element for the new mode.

The disposal here is synchronous. When releasing the object needs an `await`,
this family is the wrong one: `LiteScope` gives a state with
`disposeStateAsync`, and `Scope` gives a dependency container whose `dispose`
is awaited — and both make a parent wait for their child scopes before tearing
themselves down.

## In the debugger

The element adds the model to its diagnostics, so `debugDumpApp()` and the
widget inspector show `model: Cart(3 items)` — whatever the `toString` of the
model returns — next to the scope.
