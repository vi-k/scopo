# LiteScope

A state class with the whole scope lifecycle behind it, and no dependency
container in front of it. `initState` and `dispose` as usual, plus an
asynchronous `initStateAsync` and a `disposeStateAsync` the scope waits for,
plus `notifyDependents`, `close()`, `scopeKey` and the waiting for child
scopes.

This is the family for per-screen state that owns things worth releasing
properly — controllers, subscriptions, a socket. `Scope` adds a dependency
container in front of the state; `AsyncScope` drops the state and keeps only
the lifecycle.

```dart
final class ScreenScope extends LiteScope<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState> {
  const ScreenScope({super.key, super.scopeKey});

  @override
  Widget? buildOnWaiting(BuildContext context) => const SizedBox.shrink();

  @override
  ScreenScopeState createState() => ScreenScopeState();

  static ScreenScopeState of(BuildContext context) =>
      LiteScope.of<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState>(context);
}

final class ScreenScopeState
    extends LiteScopeState<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState> {
  final controller = ScrollController();

  @override
  Future<void> disposeStateAsync() async => controller.dispose();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) =>
      ListView(controller: controller, children: const [Text('item')]);
}
```

## The state

`LiteScopeState` is a `State` with five additions:

| member | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `initStateAsync()` | asynchronous initialization, started once the state exists |
| `onUnmount()` | synchronous teardown, always before `disposeStateAsync()` |
| `disposeStateAsync()` | asynchronous teardown, awaited before the scope is gone |
| `notifyDependents()` | rebuild the subscribed descendants, not the subtree |
| `close()` | run the teardown while the scope is still on screen |

and three of its own properties: `params` — the scope widget, so its
constructor parameters are readable from the state; `isInitialized`; and
`onInitialized()`, the hook called once the initialization has fully completed.

`State.widget` is not among them, and it never will be: a scope state has no
widget of its own — `params` is the scope widget, and that is the whole answer.
Reading `widget` throws an `UnsupportedError` saying so, which is what a
`State` mixin written for ordinary widgets runs into.

The ordinary `initState` of a `State` still works and still runs synchronously,
and `initStateAsync` is where an `await` belongs. `disposeStateAsync` is what
makes a parent scope — and `close()` — wait for the release to finish rather
than fire and forget it.

**`dispose` is the one to be careful with.** It belongs to Flutter, not to the
scope, and it is not part of the teardown order below: when the scope is
removed from the tree the framework calls it before the scope's own teardown
even begins, and after a `close()` it does not run until the tree comes down —
which may be much later, or never while the closing screen is on show. So the
synchronous half of a scope's teardown goes in `onUnmount()`, which the scope
itself drives:

```dart
@override
void onUnmount() {
  _subscription.cancel();   // must stop reaching this scope, now
  super.onUnmount();
}

@override
Future<void> disposeStateAsync() => _connection.close();   // may take its time
```

`onUnmount()` runs exactly once and always before `disposeStateAsync()`,
whichever way the scope goes. The `BuildContext` is gone by the time it runs on
a removed scope, so it may only touch what the state holds in its own fields.

**Both halves run after an `initStateAsync()` that threw**, in the same order
as after one that succeeded — so a disposer has to expect a partially
initialized state: a field the `await` never reached is still unset when it
runs. A failed initialization is not one that never happened. An initializer
that opened a connection and threw on the next line has opened it, and nothing
else is holding it: the scope never becomes ready, so its owner is never handed
the state either, and this hook is the only release there is. Release therefore
belongs here rather than in front of every `throw` — what it must not do is
assume the initializer got to the end.

## Two initializations

There are two phases, and they are not the same thing.

`LiteScope.initScope()` on the **widget** is a pre-initialization: an ordinary
`async` function taking a `ScopeInitContext`, exactly as in the `AsyncScope`
topic, running *before* the state is created. Its default body is empty — ready
at once — which is why most scopes never override it. Override it when
something has to be ready before `createState`, and then `buildOnProgress` and
`buildOnError` have to be overridden too — their default implementations throw
`UnimplementedError`, on the reasoning that a progress branch nobody wrote is a
mistake rather than a blank screen.

`LiteScopeState.initStateAsync()` on the **state** is the usual one, and it
runs after the state exists — which is why **nothing waits for it**. The state
is created by the ready branch, so by the time this can start, the ready branch
has already built: the first `build` of the state runs before `initStateAsync`
has finished, and so do the ones any change asks for in the meantime.

That makes `isInitialized` part of writing the state rather than a detail: a
`late` field assigned after an `await` and read straight from `build` throws a
`LateInitializationError` on that first build. Either hold the branch back
yourself —

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (!isInitialized) {
    return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator.adaptive());
  }
  …
}
```

— or give the field a value it can be read with before the initialization
replaces it. `onInitialized()` is the other half: it runs once
`initStateAsync()` has finished, and only while the state is still on the tree,
so it is where a first `notifyDependents()` or an animation belongs. Put
whatever has to be ready *before* anything is shown into `initScope()` on the
widget instead, which is the phase that does hold the ready branch back.

`buildOnWaiting` covers the gap before either of them has produced anything —
the frames spent waiting for a `scopeKey` and for the first event. Returning
`null` from it is allowed only when `buildOnProgress` is overridden, since
something has to be on screen.

That is why `buildOnWaiting` is the one builder a `LiteScope` must write, which
is the other way round from `Scope` and the asynchronous families, where
`buildOnProgress` is the required one. The rule behind both is the same:
**exactly one branch before the ready one has to be written, and it is the one
the family is certain to reach.** A `Scope` always initializes a container, so
it always has a progress branch and may skip the waiting one; a `LiteScope`
initializes nothing of its own, so what it always has is the wait. Moving a
screen from `Scope` to `LiteScope` therefore trades one required builder for
another: `buildOnProgress` and `buildOnError` become optional — keep them only
if you override `initScope()` — and `buildOnWaiting` becomes required.

`wrapState` wraps the ready branch alone, so a widget every branch needs is
built inside each builder instead.

## Access from the subtree

```dart
ScreenScope.of(context).controller;                    // the state
LiteScope.select<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState, int>(  // one value from it
  context,
  (state) => state.itemCount,
);
LiteScope.paramsOf<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState>(context, listen: false);
LiteScope.selectParam<ScreenScope, ScreenScopeState, Object?>(
  context,
  (widget) => widget.scopeKey,
);
```

`of` and `maybeOf` return the state and never subscribe — they are for calling
methods. `select` subscribes to one value derived from the state, and the
caller is rebuilt only when that value changes **and** only when the state
called `notifyDependents()`. Nothing else in the state is observed: a field
mutated without that call reaches nobody.

`setState` is the other half, and nothing here takes it away — a scope state is
an ordinary `State` and keeps it. The two do not overlap, which is the part an
analogy with `StatefulWidget` gets wrong: `notifyDependents()` rebuilds the
subscribers and leaves this state's own `build` unrun, while `setState`
rebuilds what this state's `build` returns and reaches no subscriber. A field
both sides read wants both calls; a field only one side reads wants only its
own.

`paramsOf` and `selectParam` do the same for the scope widget's own parameters.
Re-exposing all of this as named statics on the scope, as `of` above, is the
usual practice.

## close()

```dart
await ScreenScope.of(context).close();
```

`close()` starts the teardown while the scope is still on screen, and completes
when the disposal is over. The ready subtree is frozen into a screenshot,
`buildOnClosing` is shown on top of it, and the element stays mounted until the
end — which is the point: a scope that takes a noticeable time to release
things shows "closing…" instead of freezing on its last frame.

The screenshot is best-effort in a precise sense: it is installed only when the
scope is actually ready and still mounted, because in any other state nothing
would ever release the barrier and the future would hang. A subtree that is
never painted — inside an `Offstage`, or in the unselected branch of an
`IndexedStack` — cannot be captured either; after
`ScreenshotReplacer.maxRetries` frames `close()` proceeds, and the ready
subtree is taken away all the same, with nothing in the picture's place. It has
to be: the whole point of waiting for the screenshot is to let go of what the
subtree holds, and a scope left standing there keeps its own child scopes
mounted and registered — this one would then wait out its
`waitForChildrenTimeout` for a child nobody had taken away, and release what
that child is still reading.

A closing build that fails does not hold the teardown up either. The barrier is
released by the `ScreenshotReplacer` that build mounts, so a `wrapState` or a
`buildOnClosing` that throws used to mean a `close()` that never completed and
four stages that never began. Such a failure now surfaces as the `ErrorWidget`
any failing build turns into, and the teardown behind it goes on.

The default closing overlay reads its colour from the theme **above** the
scope, which for a scope at the root of the application — one whose `wrapState`
builds the `MaterialApp` — is `ThemeData.fallback()`. Write `buildOnClosing`
there, which is what a root scope wants anyway.

Calling `close()` twice does not restart anything: the second call joins the
disposal already running rather than installing a second barrier.

## The teardown, and what waits for it

The order is the one from the `AsyncScope` topic, with the state's own steps in
it: `onUnmount()` of the state runs first, the pre-initialization is cancelled,
the child scopes are awaited (`waitForChildrenTimeout`), `disposeStateAsync()`
of the state runs, and the `scopeKey` is released last so that the next scope
with that key starts only when this one is finished.

Flutter's own `dispose()` of the state sits outside that sequence, on either
side of it depending on how the scope went: before all of it when the tree took
the scope down, after all of it when the scope closed itself. That is the whole
point of `close()` — release first, leave later — and it is why the teardown
the scope guarantees is the `onUnmount()`/`disposeStateAsync()` pair rather
than `dispose()`.

A `LiteScope` is an `AsyncScopeParent` like every asynchronous scope: the
scopes below it register with it, and it waits for them before disposing of
itself. Asking for that wait from a subtree is
`AsyncScopeCoordinator.waitForChildren` — the mixin itself sits on the element,
which is private here; see the `AsyncScope` topic.

## Where to go next

| topic | what it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `AsyncScope` | the lifecycle in full: states, teardown order, `scopeKey`, the coordinator |
| `Scope` | a dependency container in front of the same state |
| `ScopeWidget` | what `notifyDependents` does to the subtree |
| `debug` | the observer that reports every step, and the timeouts |
