# Scope

`Scope` is the main building block of the package: a widget that owns a
container of dependencies, initializes it asynchronously, builds a state on top
of it, provides both to its subtree, and finally disposes of everything in
reverse order — after its own child scopes are gone.

One scope is three types:

1. the widget — a `Scope` subclass. Its constructor parameters are the scope
   parameters, and its builders cover the waiting, initializing, error and
   closing branches.
2. the dependency container — a `ScopeDependencies` implementation, built by
   `initDependencies` before the state exists.
3. the state — a `ScopeState` subclass; the same thing as the `State` of a
   `StatefulWidget`, except that `dependencies` is already available in
   `initState`.

The lighter families (`ScopeWidgetBase`, `ScopeModel`, `ScopeNotifier`,
`AsyncScope`, `AsyncDataScope`, `AsyncControllerScope`, `LiteScope`) drop one
part or another. `Scope` is
the full set.

## The initialization branch

`initDependencies` is an ordinary `async` function that returns the container.
It is given a `ScopeInitContext` beside the `BuildContext`, and that is what
carries the two things a bare `Future` has no room for: `ctx.progress(x)`
reports a step any number of times, and the cancellation reaches the body
through `ctx` — if the widget leaves the tree while the container is still
being built, the body is thrown into at its next checkpoint, which
between two steps is usually `ctx.progress` itself, and a half-built container
is never handed to a state. For an acquisition that can be left in flight,
use `ctx.wait` with `discard:`: a value the body never receives is still
released. For a call that must finish, use `ctx.join`; a short initialization
that asks the context nothing can still use a bare call. The rule is in the
`AsyncScope` topic.

What the scope shows, and what it calls, in order:

| Phase                                                     | Builder                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| waiting for `scopeKey` and for the first step | `buildOnWaiting` — may return `null`, then `buildOnProgress(context, null)` |
| the body reported progress                                | `buildOnProgress(context, progress)`                                      |
| the body returned the container                           | `wrapState` around the `build` of the state from `createState`                 |
| the body threw                                            | `buildOnError(context, error, stackTrace, progress)`                          |
| `close()` is running                                      | `buildOnClosing`, over a frozen screenshot of the ready subtree when one can be taken |

`wrapState` wraps the ready branch only, so a widget that every branch needs (a
`MaterialApp`, typically) is built inside each builder instead.

`pauseAfterInitialization` holds the ready branch back for a fixed duration
after the container arrives, so that a loading indicator is not replaced within the same
frame it appeared in. `ScopeConfig.pauseAfterInitializationEnabled` turns all of
those pauses off at once — see the `debug` topic.

A container that only needs one `await` can be written by hand:

```dart
final class AppDependencies implements ScopeDependencies {
  final SharedPreferences sharedPreferences;

  AppDependencies({required this.sharedPreferences});

  static Future<AppDependencies> init(ScopeInitContext ctx) async {
    ctx.progress('Initializing storage…');
    final sharedPreferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();

    return AppDependencies(sharedPreferences: sharedPreferences);
  }

  /// Lets go of whatever cannot wait for the asynchronous teardown.
  @override
  void onUnmount() {}

  /// Called after the state has been disposed of. May be asynchronous.
  @override
  Future<void> dispose() async {}
}
```

A container that needs no asynchronous work at all is returned as it is —
`initDependencies` is a `Future`, and `AppDependencies()` satisfies one without
a wrapper of any kind.

The four function types the scope is built from are named as well, for anyone
passing them around: `ScopeInitCallback`, `ScopeWaitingBuilder`,
`ScopeProgressBuilder` and `ScopeErrorBuilder`.

Outside a scope, `ScopeInitJob<T>` supplies that same context: a dependency
tree walked by hand, a container built before any widget exists, a test.
Start it explicitly, then await the value:

```dart
final job = ScopeInitJob((ctx) => AppDependencies.init(ctx))..start();
final dependencies = await job.value;
```

`await job.cancel()` requests cancellation and waits for the body, its child
jobs and cleanup. If the caller need not wait, it calls `job.cancel()` without
awaiting the returned future. `job.value` throws `Cancelled` on cancellation;
`scopo` re-exports that name from `async_job`, so no second dependency is
needed.

## ScopeAutoDependencies

Writing the body by hand stops scaling as soon as the dependencies have an
order, some of them can be built in parallel, and each has its own teardown.
`ScopeAutoDependencies` is the ready-made implementation: describe the tree once
in `buildDependencies`, and its `init` walks the tree, reports progress per
dependency, and disposes of whatever was already built if something fails.

```dart
final class HomeDependencies
    extends ScopeAutoDependencies<HomeDependencies, void> {
  late final ApiClient apiClient;
  late final Settings settings;
  late final Session session;

  @override
  ScopeDependency buildDependencies(_) => sequential('', [
        dep('apiClient', (dep) async {
          apiClient = ApiClient();
          dep.dispose = apiClient.close;

          await apiClient.init();
        }),
        concurrent('user', [
          dep('settings', (dep) async {
            settings = await Settings.load();
            dep.dispose = settings.save;
          }),
          dep('session', (dep) async {
            session = await Session.restore(apiClient);
            dep.dispose = session.close;
          }),
        ]),
      ]);
}
```

**`late final` makes the container single-use, and that is usually what you
want.** A container is an object, and `init()` can be called on it a second
time — after its `dispose()` has run to its end, and only then. That second
run builds the tree afresh and runs every initializer again, over the same
container, and a `late final` field the first run assigned refuses the second
assignment. Declare the fields `late` rather than `late final` for a container
you mean to initialize more than once; a `Scope` builds a container per scope
and never reaches this, so the fields above stay `final`. The package says as
much where it will be read: a field that refuses the second run fails with the
reason attached, not with the bare `LateInitializationError` the field itself
throws.

An `init()` at any other moment — while one is running, or on a container that
has been initialized and not disposed of — is refused with a `StateError` that
says which of the two it was. It is refused whether or not the tree is holding
anything: holding nothing is not the same as having been given back.

Four builders describe the tree, and all of them return a `ScopeDependency`:

- `dep(name, init)` — a single dependency. The `ScopeDependencyHandle` handed to `init` is
  where the reverse operations are registered: `dep.unmount` runs synchronously
  before anything is released, `dep.dispose` is awaited during the disposal.
  Setting neither is fine — a dependency that owns nothing needs no teardown.
  The name must not be empty.
- `controllerDep(name, create)` — a single dependency backed by a
  `ScopeController`: `create` builds it, and its `performUnmount` /
  `performDispose` are wired to the handle before `performInit` is awaited,
  so the usual `dep` teardown promises hold for it too. The same controller
  class that owns an `AsyncControllerScope` fits here unchanged — see
  [AsyncControllerScope](https://pub.dev/documentation/scopo/latest/topics/AsyncControllerScope-topic.html).
- `sequential(name, [...])` — a `ScopeDependencyGroup` whose children are
  initialized one after another, and torn down in reverse order — both
  `dep.unmount` and `dep.dispose`.
- `concurrent(name, [...])` — the same, except that the children are
  initialized (and disposed of) in parallel, so progress arrives in completion
  order rather than declaration order.

Groups nest freely and a group name may be empty (see the paths below).

The **first** type parameter of `ScopeAutoDependencies` is the class being
declared — `HomeDependencies extends ScopeAutoDependencies<HomeDependencies,
…>`. It is what the container hands the scope once the tree is up, so it is what
`Scope.of` returns to the subtree. Naming another container there is the one
mistake this parameter invites, and it is refused before anything is built: the
type of the container that finishes cannot be the type of a container that never
started.

The **second** is what `buildDependencies` receives: `void` for the container
above, which needs nothing from the outside; declare `BuildContext` instead when
a dependency has to read something from the tree.

Wiring the container into the scope is one call:

```dart
@override
Future<HomeDependencies> initDependencies(
  BuildContext context,
  ScopeInitContext ctx,
) =>
    HomeDependencies().init(null, ctx);
```

With a `BuildContext` container, forward the `context` of `initDependencies`
instead of `null`.

Every step the container reports carries a `ScopeAutoDependenciesProgress`: `path` —
the path of the dependency that has just been initialized — `name`, the last
segment of that path, which is the name the dependency was declared with, plus
the step counter of a `ProgressIterator` (`number`, `total`, and `value` as a
fraction between 0 and 1). That object is what `buildOnProgress` receives,
so a progress bar with a caption needs nothing else:

```dart
@override
Widget buildOnProgress(
  BuildContext context,
  covariant ScopeAutoDependenciesProgress? progress,
) =>
    Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        LinearProgressIndicator(value: progress?.value ?? 0),
        Text(progress?.path ?? ''),
      ],
    );
```

`autoDisposeOnError` (`true` by default) is what makes a failed initialization
clean up after itself: when the tree did not reach the initialized state, the
container's `dispose` runs before the error reaches `buildOnError`. Override it
with `false` to keep the half-built tree for inspection.

### Register the teardown the moment you have something to tear down

The disposal releases what a dependency **registered**, not what it finished
with: an initializer that took a resource and set `dep.dispose` keeps that
resource whether it then succeeded, failed or was cancelled. Which puts the
whole weight on where the registration sits.

```dart
// Wrong: the migration throws, nothing is registered, and the database stays
// open with nobody left to close it.
dep('database', (dep) async {
  final database = await Database.open();
  await database.migrate();
  dep.dispose = database.close;
}),
```

```dart
// Right: registered before anything else can fail.
dep('database', (dep) async {
  final database = await Database.open();
  dep.dispose = database.close;

  await database.migrate();
}),
```

The rule reads as one line: **acquire, register, then carry on.** Nothing
between the acquisition and the registration may `await`, throw, or be
cancelled — and in Dart the first of those implies the other two.

`dep.dispose` may be reassigned as the initializer goes, which is what a
dependency that builds several things in sequence does: register a closure that
releases everything taken so far, and widen it after each step. Setting neither
`dep.dispose` nor `dep.unmount` is fine for a dependency that owns nothing —
after the teardown it says `no disposal required`, so a tree dump still shows
that the walk reached it.

### What a failure costs, and what it does not

A failed dependency stops its own group, and the teardown above releases
everything already built — provided each leaf registered what it took. Where the
walk stops is worth knowing:

- **A sequential group** stops at the first failure; the children before it are
  released in reverse order.
- **A concurrent group** cancels the arms still running when one of them fails.
  A cancelled arm learns of it at a context checkpoint; a bare `await` runs
  on, and the group waits for the arms to finish. This is the second reason to
  register early: whatever an arm had already registered is still released,
  whatever it had not is not.
- **The disposal itself does not stop at a failure.** Each release is guarded on
  its own, the walk finishes, and the first failure is passed on afterwards.
  Every failure is recorded on the dependency it belongs to and readable through
  `flattenDependenciesWithErrors()`.

And with `autoDisposeOnError` set to `false`, releasing the half-built tree is
yours to do.

### A hand-written container cleans up after itself

`ScopeAutoDependencies` is what runs the teardown of a failed initialization.
A container written by hand declares its own cleanup: the scope stores the
container only after the initialization job succeeds, and a body that failed
before that never handed one over. Nothing the scope holds points at it,
and its `dispose()` is never called.

So an `init` written by hand takes the same shape as the one in the `AsyncScope`
topic — what a step took is given back unless the container was handed over:

```dart
static Future<AppDependencies> init(ScopeInitContext ctx) async {
  final storage = await Storage.open();

  try {
    ctx.progress('signing in');
    final session = await Session.restore(storage);

    return AppDependencies(storage: storage, session: session);
  } on Object {
    // A failing step and a cancellation both arrive here, and returning is
    // the handover — so reaching this and reaching the handover are
    // exclusive, and no flag is needed to tell them apart.
    await storage.close();
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

`catch` covers a cancellation too: the scope removed from the tree before it
was ready is reported as `Cancelled` at a checkpoint such as `ctx.progress`.
The context's `wait(discard:)` can keep the same guard without a handwritten
`catch`; the `AsyncScope` topic has the whole of it. This is also the shape
the container writes for you: what a dependency registered with
`dep.dispose` is released whether the walk failed or was cancelled.

## Inspecting the tree

Whatever the outcome, the container exposes what it built: `root` is the top
`ScopeDependency`, `flattenDependencies()` walks it depth-first into
`ScopeDependencyInfo` records (`level`, `path`, `dependency`), and
`flattenDependenciesWithErrors()` narrows the walk to the entries that hold a
real error rather than a propagated `ScopeDependencyException`. Each dependency
also carries a `ScopeDependencyState` — `ScopeDependencyInitial`,
`ScopeDependencyInitialized`, `ScopeDependencyFailed`,
`ScopeDependencyCancelled`, `ScopeDependencyDisposed`,
`ScopeDependencyNoDisposalRequired`, `ScopeDependencyDisposalFailed` — and
the `isInitialized`, `isFailed`,
`isCancelled` and `isDisposed` shorthands of `ScopeDependencyExtension`.

`ScopeDependencyNoDisposalRequired` is the state of a dependency that set no
`dep.dispose` and so had nothing to give back: the teardown passes it by, and
this is what it says afterwards. It is a `ScopeDependencyDisposed`, so
`isDisposed` covers both.

A teardown walk always runs to its end. It used to be interruptible — the walk
was a stream, and a caller who drove one could stop listening halfway — and
that possibility went with the stream: leaving half a tree still holding what
it took is the shape this package exists to close, not one to offer.

## Dependency paths

A dependency is identified by its path from the root of the tree: the names of
the enclosing groups and its own name, joined with `/`. The format is
canonical — there is **no leading slash**, and an anonymous group (a group whose
name is the empty string) contributes no segment and no separator at all. So the
root group of a tree is usually anonymous, and the paths of its children read as
if it were not there.

For the tree

```dart
sequential('', [
  dep('dep1', …),
  concurrent('concurrent1', [
    dep('dep2', …),
    sequential('sequential1', [
      dep('dep3', …),
    ]),
  ]),
])
```

the paths are `dep1`, `concurrent1/dep2` and `concurrent1/sequential1/dep3`.
The same strings appear in three places: in `ScopeAutoDependenciesProgress.path`,
in what the container reports to `ScopeConfig.observer` while it initializes and
while it disposes, and in `ScopeDependencyException.name`.

`ScopeDependencyInfo.path` is the one that is not the whole path but the prefix
of it. The walk it comes from visits the groups as well as the leaves, so each
entry carries the path of the groups *around* it — ending with `/`, and empty at
the root — while its own name sits beside it in `dependency.name`. The canonical
path of an entry is therefore `'${info.path}${info.dependency.name}'`.

## Errors

An error thrown by a `dep` initializer is wrapped in a
`ScopeDependencyException`, which carries the `name` (the path above), the
original `error` and its `stackTrace`. As the exception travels up through the
enclosing groups, each named group prepends its own segment, so what reaches
`buildOnError` names the exact dependency that failed:

```text
concurrent1/sequential1/dep3: Exception: no network
```

An empty `name` means the anonymous root dependency itself failed.

The group that saw the failure stops requiring initialization and switches to
`ScopeDependencyFailed`, keeping the failure it saw — one of them, even when a
`concurrent` group had several children fail at once: the first failure
cancels the arms beside it, so the group keeps the one that ended it. Every dependency keeps its own errors, and
`flattenDependenciesWithErrors()` walks the tree for them. The `stateToString()`
of a group summarizes what it holds: the failed child by name, and any error that
is not itself a `ScopeDependencyException` listed as unresolved.

## Disposal, unmount and close

The teardown of a scope happens in a fixed order, and every asynchronous step of
it is awaited:

1. `onUnmount` — synchronous, always first, and before any asynchronous step
   begins. It runs exactly once, whichever way the scope goes: removed from the
   widget tree, or closed with `close()` while it stays on screen. The scope
   runs `ScopeState.onUnmount` and then forwards to
   `ScopeDependencies.onUnmount`, which `ScopeAutoDependencies` forwards further
   to every `dep.unmount`, in reverse declaration order. This is the place for
   whatever has to happen immediately and cannot wait for the asynchronous
   teardown — unsubscribing, for instance.

   Flutter's own `State.dispose` is not part of this order and cannot be: the
   framework calls it before the whole teardown when the tree takes the scope
   down, and not until the tree comes down after a `close()`. It is sealed on
   `ScopeState` for that reason.
2. An initialization still in flight is cancelled, or awaited if it cannot be
   cancelled. The cancellation is bounded by `initCancellationTimeout`
   (`ScopeConfig.defaultInitCancellationTimeout` by default), so that an
   initialization parked on a future that never completes cannot hold the
   teardown behind it.
3. The child scopes are awaited, so that a parent never disposes of a
   dependency a child is still using. The wait is bounded by
   `waitForChildrenTimeout` (`ScopeConfig.defaultWaitForChildrenTimeout` by
   default).
4. `ScopeState.disposeStateAsync` — the state's own asynchronous teardown, bounded
   by `disposeScopeTimeout` (`ScopeConfig.defaultDisposeScopeTimeout` by
   default), so that a teardown which never completes cannot hold the release
   of the `scopeKey` in step 6.
5. `ScopeDependencies.dispose` — for a `ScopeAutoDependencies`, this walks the
   tree in reverse: the children of a `sequential` group in reverse declaration
   order, the children of a `concurrent` group in parallel, and only those that
   actually registered a `dep.dispose`. **Bounded by `disposeScopeTimeout` of
   its own**, not by what step 4 left of it: one limit around both meant that a
   state which never finished cost the container its whole disposal. A teardown
   where both steps hang therefore reports two expiries — two steps were given
   up on.
6. The `scopeKey`, if any, is released, and the next scope waiting for it is let
   through.

Every step is guarded on its own, and so are the two halves of steps 1 and 4–5:
a failure in one is never a reason to skip what comes behind it. Only one
failure can be passed on, though — that is all a throw carries — and it is the
first one, handed over once the whole teardown is over. Every failure behind it
is reported through `FlutterError.reportError` instead. So a state whose
`onUnmount` threw and whose container threw behind it says both things: the
state's failure through the throw, the container's through a report.

`close()` starts that same teardown while the scope is still on screen: the
ready subtree is frozen into a screenshot, `buildOnClosing` is shown on top of
it, and the returned future completes when the disposal is done. It is the way
to run "closing…" UI for a scope whose disposal takes a noticeable amount of
time, instead of freezing on the last frame. Taking the screenshot is
best-effort: a subtree that is never painted — one inside an `Offstage`, or in
the unselected branch of an `IndexedStack` — cannot be captured. The attempt is
bounded by `ScreenshotReplacer.maxRetries` frames, after which `close()`
proceeds and the ready subtree is taken away all the same, with nothing in the
picture's place: `buildOnClosing` runs over an empty background rather than
over a live subtree. It has to — the point of waiting for the screenshot is to
let go of what the subtree holds, and a subtree left standing keeps its own
child scopes mounted. The `LiteScope` topic says the same at greater length.

### Two initializations, and what a failure of each leaves behind

A `Scope` initializes **twice**, and the six steps above name hooks from both
halves without saying which is which. Read in that order:

1. **The container.** `initDependencies` builds the dependency tree. Only when
   it returns the container does the scope build its ready branch — and only then
   is there a state at all.
2. **The state.** `createState()`, then `initState()` — where `dependencies`
   are already in place, which is the whole point of the family — then
   `initStateAsync()`, the state's own asynchronous half. `onInitialized()` runs
   right after that succeeds, and `isInitialized` reports it.

The teardown mirrors that pair, and so does what happens when either half
fails:

| what runs | ready, then gone | `initDependencies` failed | state `initStateAsync` failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ScopeState.initState` | yes | **no state exists** | yes |
| `ScopeState.onUnmount` | yes | — | **yes** |
| `dep.unmount` | yes, every dependency | yes, every dependency | yes, every dependency |
| `ScopeState.disposeStateAsync` | yes | — | **yes** |
| `dep.dispose` | yes, in reverse | yes, in reverse | yes, in reverse |

On the ordinary path the four run interleaved, state before dependencies in
each half: `ScopeState.onUnmount`, then `dep.unmount`, then
`ScopeState.disposeStateAsync`, then `dep.dispose`. Both halves walk a group the
same way, in reverse of the declaration order: a later dependency is built on
top of an earlier one, so it stops reaching the world before that one lets go
of anything.

**When `initDependencies` failed, the state is the part that never existed.**
`createState()` runs when the ready branch is built, and a scope that failed
never builds it — so there is nothing for `ScopeState.onUnmount` and
`ScopeState.disposeStateAsync` to run on. Do not put the release of something taken
during `initDependencies` in either of them: on the path where it matters most
they are not there to run.

**When the state's `initStateAsync` failed, the state exists and both halves of
its teardown run**, in the same order as on the ordinary path. `onUnmount()`
runs — it is the synchronous half, and a state that got as far as
`initState()` may already hold a subscription. So does `disposeStateAsync()`: a
failed initialization is not one that never happened, and an initializer that
opened a connection and threw on the next line has opened it. Nothing else is
holding it, either — the scope never becomes ready, so its owner is never
handed the state. **A disposer therefore has to expect a partially initialized
state:** a field the `await` never reached is still unset when it runs. That is
the rule `ScopeController.dispose` has always stated for the controller family,
and the state layer keeps it too.

**The dependencies are given back on every path**, and on the failing one not
by the element. The element is handed the container only together with
the container, so when `initDependencies` failed it never has one to reach for.
The container tears itself down from inside its own initialization instead,
which is what `ScopeAutoDependencies.autoDisposeOnError` is: `dep.unmount` for
every dependency, then `dep.dispose` for everything that registered one, in
reverse. The promise `dep.unmount` carries — exactly once, always before
`dep.dispose` — holds on that route as it does on the other.

Turning `autoDisposeOnError` off keeps the half-built tree for inspection and
leaves the disposal to you. The unmounting still happens: a container held for
inspection is holding subscriptions, and they should not wait for you to get
round to it.

Read across the families, the line runs between the hooks that release
something and the hooks that were written about a finished thing. **What
releases runs whatever happened; what was written about a finished thing does
not run on one that never finished.** `dep.dispose` here,
`ScopeController.dispose` in the `AsyncControllerScope` topic — where the table
says `init()` threw → disposed — and `ScopeState.disposeStateAsync` here are of
the first kind, and they run. `disposeScope` in the `AsyncScope` and
`AsyncDataScope` topics is of the second, and it is skipped when the
initialization of the scope itself never reached `AsyncScopeReady`: release
what a failing `initScope` took before it throws.

So the rule of thumb is the one from the `AsyncScope` topic, and it applies to
both halves. Whatever an initialization takes before it fails, that same
initialization gives back — through `dep.dispose` when it was taken through
`dep`, and by its own hand when it was not:

```dart
// Wrong: the connection is open and no hook will ever be handed it.
initDependencies: (context, ctx) async {
  final connection = await Connection.open();

  return somethingThatFails();
}

// Right: what this initializer took, this initializer registers.
ScopeDependency buildDependencies(BuildContext context) => sequential('', [
      dep('connection', (dep) async {
        final connection = await Connection.open();
        dep.dispose = connection.close;
      }),
      dep('somethingThatFails', (dep) async { /* ... */ }),
    ]);
```

The state's own half is where this differs: `disposeStateAsync()` *is* called
after an `initStateAsync()` that threw, so the release belongs there rather
than in front of every `throw`. What it must not do is assume the initializer
got to the end.

## Access from the subtree

The state is reached through the static helpers of `Scope`, which every scope
normally re-exposes as its own named accessors:

- `Scope.of` and `Scope.maybeOf` — the state, without subscribing. For calling
  methods.
- `Scope.select` — one value derived from the state; the caller is rebuilt only
  when that value changes, and only when the state calls `notifyDependents`.
- `Scope.paramsOf` and `Scope.selectParam` — the same for the scope parameters,
  i.e. the fields of the widget itself.

`notifyDependents` rebuilds the subscribed descendants without rebuilding the
state's own subtree, which is what makes a scope usable for high-frequency
updates. `setState` is the other half and is untouched — a scope state is an
ordinary `State`: it rebuilds what the state's own `build` returns and reaches
no subscriber. A field both sides read wants both calls.

`isInitialized` reports whether the initialization has fully completed, and
`onInitialized` is the hook called right after it has.
