scopo is a Flutter package designed for managing scopes and dependency injection
within the widget tree. It handles asynchronous initialization of dependencies
and provides a structured way to access them.

A description will be provided later. For now, you can see an
[minimal example](https://github.com/vi-k/scopo/tree/main/example/minimal) and
[full demo](https://github.com/vi-k/scopo/tree/main/example/scopo_demo).
