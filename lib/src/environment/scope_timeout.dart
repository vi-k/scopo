/// The one value a single scope has for "wait as long as it takes".
///
/// Every timeout parameter of a scope is a `Duration?`, and all three of its
/// values were spoken for: absent or `null` means "take the default from
/// [ScopeConfig]", [Duration.zero] means "expire at once", and any other
/// [Duration] is the limit itself. [none] is the fourth, and it removes the
/// limit for that one scope — which was possible only for every scope at
/// once, by setting the matching `ScopeConfig.default…` to `null`.
///
/// ```dart
/// AsyncScope(
///   waitForChildrenTimeout: ScopeTimeout.none,
///   disposeScopeTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 5),
///   …
/// )
/// ```
///
/// It is accepted by `scopeKeyTimeout`, `disposeScopeTimeout` and
/// `waitForChildrenTimeout`, on the scopes and on `waitForChildren`, and by
/// all four [ScopeConfig] defaults, where it says for the whole application
/// what `null` says there — and **not** by `initCancellationTimeout`, which
/// asserts against it. A cancellation waits for a generator to run out, and a
/// generator suspended on a future that never completes never does; waiting
/// for that with no limit is the hang the limit was put there to prevent.
/// That is a decision for the whole application, so
/// [ScopeConfig.defaultInitCancellationTimeout] does take it.
///
/// Anywhere else a [Duration] is asked for it is refused, with an assert:
/// `pauseAfterInitialization` is a stretch of time to hold the ready branch
/// back for rather than a limit on a wait, and "wait as long as it takes" has
/// nothing to say about one.
///
/// **It is recognised by its type, so it does not survive being computed
/// with.** `ScopeTimeout.none == const Duration(microseconds: -1)` is `true`
/// and `ScopeTimeout.none + Duration.zero` is an ordinary [Duration]: what
/// comes back from any arithmetic is the negative length behind the marker,
/// which a timer reads as "expire at once". The package asserts against a
/// negative limit everywhere it resolves one, so this is loud in debug rather
/// than silent — but a timeout is a value to pass on, not one to compute
/// with.
