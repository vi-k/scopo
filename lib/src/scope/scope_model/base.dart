  /// The model, its disposer and -- for a notifier -- its listener all belong
  /// to the mode the scope came into being in, and it is fixed for the
  /// lifetime of the element. Switching in place has no honest answer:
  /// arriving at the owning constructor there is nothing to own, since
  /// `create` runs once and has already not run; leaving it, the model this
  /// scope made is still its to release, and the widget that says who releases
  /// it is gone.
  ///
  /// Both were silent before. `.value` to owning dereferenced a `value` that
  /// is no longer there; owning to `.value` kept the model the scope had made,
  /// ignored the one it was handed, and left nothing to ever release the
  /// first.
  ///
  /// **"Refuses" here means an assertion, and an assertion is debug-only.** In
  /// a release build the switch still happens, and it still ends the two ways
  /// above: a leaked model with a listener pointing at it, or a null check on
  /// a `value` that is gone. Nothing repairs it at runtime, because there is
  /// nothing honest to repair it with — see the paragraph above — so what a
  /// release build is left with is what the assertion is there to keep out of
  /// it. Test in debug, where it is loud.
  ///
  /// To change the mode, give the widget a different [Widget.key]: the
  /// framework then builds a new element, which reads the mode afresh and
  /// releases what the old one owned.
