/// A scope that waits for the scopes below it before disposing of itself.
///
/// The nearest ancestor with this mixin — a parent scope, or the
/// [AsyncScopeCoordinator] when there is no parent scope — is what a scope
/// registers with. A scope with neither above it registers nowhere and nobody
/// waits for it.
///
/// The mixin sits on the element, and the elements of the built-in families
/// are private, so [hasChildren], [childrenCount] and [waitForChildren] are
/// reachable from a scope of your own — a family built on [AsyncScopeCore],
/// reading them on `this` — rather than from a subtree looking upwards.
/// [AsyncScope.of] and its siblings hand back an [AsyncScopeContext], which
/// carries the state of the scope and none of these. From a subtree, the wait
/// to ask for is [AsyncScopeCoordinator.waitForChildren], which awaits the
/// scopes registered with the nearest coordinator rather than the children of
/// one particular scope.
///
/// The [ScopeObservable] constraint is what lets an expired wait for the
/// children reach `ScopeConfig.observer` from here, under the same label the
/// rest of the scope's events carry. Every element of the package already
/// answers to it; a parent of your own has to, and [debugLabel] is all it
/// asks for.

  /// chose for this particular scope — and because it is the name the two
  /// neighbouring waits already use: [AsyncScopeCoordinator.waitForChildren] and
  /// a scope's own teardown. Override it in a parent of your own if it has a
  /// better name to give.
